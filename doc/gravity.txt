*** Useful data for newtonian simulations:

Earth:
- mass: 5.972E24 kg
- radius: 6371 km
- escape velocity: 11.2 km/s
- orbital speed: 8 km/s

Orbital speed:
- v = sqrt( ( M^2 . G ) / ( (m + M) x r ) )
  - M = mass of object being orbited
  - m = body under consideration
  - G = gravitational constant = 6.67384 x 10^-11
  - r = distance
